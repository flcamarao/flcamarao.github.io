<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Executive Summary</h1>

***

The purpose of this report is to evaluate the potential benefits of incorporating a more innovative clustering technique in the import tax assessment process of the Philippine Bureau of Customs (BoC). The study was based on the Bureau of Customs import data collected from 2016-2022, consolidated using SQLlite3, and analyzed using the 'GOODS_DESCRIPTION' feature. The data was used to cluster Philippine importations from China, which is the largest importer in terms of dutiable value and tax payments during the specified period.

The results of the study indicated that the use of agglomerative clustering was an efficient solution for reducing and grouping the imported goods into 15 clusters. This solution outperformed the traditional method used by the agency, which has over a thousand sections and chapters for categorizing goods. The integration of innovative clustering techniques, such as agglomerative clustering, into the BoC's assessment process could significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the import tax assessment process.

In today's rapidly changing global marketplace, it is imperative for organizations like the BoC to continuously seek new and innovative solutions that will improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness. The report recommends that the BoC consider the integration of innovative clustering techniques into their assessment process to stay ahead of the curve and provide better services to their stakeholders.

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Problem Statement</h1>

***

With the aim of optimizing the assignment and classification of imported goods utilized by the Bureau of Customs, how might we leverage a more innovative clustering technique, either as a replacement or supplementary method, to the traditional divisions by sections and chapters?

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Motivation</h1>

***

he Bureau of Customs is one of the government agencies under the Philippine Department of Finance. It is in charge of overseeing the country's trade and customs when engaging in foreign commerce. Among its responsibilities are assessing and collecting customs revenues, i.e., monitoring and auditing[/taxing] the goods imported and exported across the country's ports [of entry]. This bureau is also responsible for combating corruption, smuggling, and other forms of illegal trade and customs fraud. [[1]](https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/section/briefing-room/department-of-finance/bureau-of-customs/)


The BoC is lead by the Commissioner; assisted by six deputy commissioners, one assistant commissioner, and seventeen district collectors.[[2]](https://customs.gov.ph/offices/) Senior-level agency leaders like the commissioner position are designated via presidential appointments. During the term (June 2016-June 2022) of the previous administration of Former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte (PRRD), the BoC experienced three changes in management initially headed by Former Marine Captain Nicanor Faeldon who assumed office on June 30, 2016. Isidro S. Lape√±a started office on August 30, 2017 and finally followed by Retired General Rey Leonardo Guerrero of the Armed Forces of the Philippines on October 31, 2018 onwards until the end of the former country president's term.


This study was conducted to answer the question, how did the changes in management at the BoC affect the importation over the previous administration's 6-year term? It also aims to detect the abnormalities or differences in their customs process through their data.

Currently, the said agency is using conventional methods by categorizing the imported goods into sections and chapters. As their digitalization and automation efforts are being initiated, how can they take advantage of novel and innovative techniques to optimize their processes and therefore, enhance their operational efficiency and effectiveness.[[3]](https://customs.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BOC-Accomplishments-Duterte-Legacy-2016-2022.pdf)

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Methodology</h1>

***

This section describes the necessary steps taken by the team in order to answer the  objective of the study, 

| No. | Step | Description |
| -: | :- | :- |
| 1. | **Data extraction** | Obtain Philippine Customs importation data from 2015 to 2022 for years 2015 and 2020 from jojie-collected public datasets (directory: /mnt/data/public) and store those in sqlite3 databases. |
| 2. | **Data cleaning** | Prepare, clean, and process the collected data accordingly to get the relevant data subsets and columns. |
| 3. | **Data processing** | Remove or add necessary columns for further analysis and create functions in preparation for data exploration. |
| 4. | **Data Exploration** | Provide a list of objectives and questions that would be explored, analyzed, and answered in the subsequent sections pertaining to trends, patterns, and insights regarding the Philippine Importation. |
| 5. | **Dimension Reduction** | Extract important features from the dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer and reduce the number of components using Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) |
| 6. | **Data Clustering** | Perform clustering on the data using different methods such as agglomerative clustering (Ward's Method), representative-based clustering (KMeans) and Density based clustering DBSCAN

The detailed steps performed related to the above-presented methodology is presented in the *Data Exploration and Results and Discussion* sections of this document.

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Data Source and Description</h1>

**IMPORTATION DATA:**

The source of the importation data is the Bureau of Customs' website's customs processing system called the E2M (Electronic-to-Mobile). It contains downloadable excel files that were scraped and made available to the team via the jojie-collected public datasets (directory: /mnt/data/public/customs) of the Asian Institute of Management (AIM). 

The specific data used for this study includes all the monthly excel files from January 2015 to September 2022 which contain 33,293,684 rows and varying numbers of columns depending on the report available. Though there were more columns present in such files, only the following columns were used and considered relevant for this study:

| Column Name | Data Type | Short description |
| :---------- | :-------- | :---------------- |
|MONTH_YEAR	| TEXT | Assessment month and year based on the filename |
|HS_CODE | TEXT | 11-digit Harmonized System (HS) code. This contains identification codes given to goods for use in international trade|
|COUNTRY_EXPORT | TEXT | Name of the Exporting Country |
|PREFERENTIAL_CODE | TEXT | Code used for preferential treatment of importation based on Free Trade Agreement |
|DUTIABLE_VALUE_FOREIGN	| REAL | Financial value of the shipment based on invoice in foreign currency |
|CURRENCY | TEXT | Currency of the dutiable_value_foreign used by the importer |
|EXCHANGE_RATE | REAL | Exchange rate used to convert the foreign value to Philippine Peso |
|DUTIABLE_VALUE_PHP | REAL | Value of the shipment in Philippine Peso |
|DUTIES_AND_TAXES | REAL | System-calculated duties and taxes |
|EXCISE_ADVALOREM_PAID | REAL | System-calculated excise tax |
|VAT_BASE | REAL | The landed cost plus excise taxes, if any |
|VAT_PAID | REAL | System-calculated Value-Added Tax |
|NET_MASS_KGS | REAL | Net weight of the shipment in kilograms|
|GOODS_DESCRIPTION | TEXT | Description of the goods |
|CHAPTER | TEXT | Description of the HS Code |

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

**OBJECTIVE:**

The objective of this EDA is to identify which subset of the data we can focus on considering that the full dataset is too big for JOJIE or our laptops to handle.

**QUESTIONS:**
 
    1. What is the trend involving Philippine importation from 2015 to 2022?
    2. Which countries dominate the Philippine importation scene? 
    3. Which chapters dominate the Philippine importation scene? Which chapters are weak?

<h3 style="color:#87CEEB">Monthly trend based on dutiable value and duties and taxes</h3>
***

```python
trends_monthly()
fig_caption(f'Customs Imports Monthly Trend', 'The huge spikes in importation from 2015 to 2022')
```
<img src='/images/customs/2.png'>

There's an increasing trend in dutiable value through the years from 2015 to 2022. There's a huge dip in March 2020 caused by the 2-week lockdown set by the government. However, after that the monthly total dutiable values of imports had been steadily increasing.

Upon inspection of the data, the sudden peak in total importation values can be attributed to electronics, specifically laptops. This was the time when offices were shifting to a work-from-home setup and some schools enforced online learning.

For the last 4 months (June-Sept 2022), the monthly dutiable value was above 700 billion PHP. This threshold has only been surpassed four other times before (Nov 2016, March 2019, July 2020, and March 2022).

We can notice four large spikes in the dutiable values corresponding to the months of November 2016, July 2017, March 2019 and July 2020. However, these spikes did not translate to increases in total duties and taxes during these months. This means that the items that caused the spikes had tax exemptions.

We will focus on these four months to cluster the importations based on the goods description.

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Top Countries Exporting to the Philippines from 2015-2022</h2>

```python
yearly_top15_countries_dv()
fig_caption(f'Dutiable value per Year', 'The dutiable value of China consistently remained number 1 among other countries.')
```
<img src='/images/customs/3.png'>

The above chart shows that the dutiable value of **CHINA** importations grew consistently from 2016 to 2020 but started decreasing slightly from 2021 onwards. It has remained the top importing country since 2016. It breached the **1 trillion PHP** mark in 2018.

Since CHINA is the run-away winner in terms of total dutiable value, we will focus to cluster the goods imported from CHINA and see if we can uncover patterns.

```python
top_countries()
```
<img src='/images/customs/4.png'>
<img src='/images/customs/5.png'>
<img src='/images/customs/6.png'>

Except for the United States, 9 out of the 10 countries with the highest dutiable value when it comes to imports are Asian countries. 4 out of these belong to ASEAN countries. These top 10 countries amounted to 77.31% of the total dutiable value imported from 2015 to 2022. Lastly, China is the biggest importer in terms of dutiable value which amounted to 19.59% of the total.

Similar to dutiable values, 9 out of the 10 countries with highest duties and taxes from importing are Asian countries except for the US. 5 out of these also belong to the ASEAN countries. The top 10 countries contributed 78.53% of the total duties and taxes from imports for the period 2015 to 2022. Similarly, China is the highest tax payer which was assessed to have 21.95% of the total duties and taxes from imports.

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Top Chapters of Goods Imported</h2>

Harmonized System Codes (HS Codes) are a standardized international classification system used to identify goods in international trade. It is a multi-purpose commodity description and coding system that assigns a unique code to every product traded internationally. The HS Codes are used by customs authorities worldwide to monitor and regulate the import and export of goods. The HS system provides a uniform basis for the collection of customs duties and taxes, as well as statistical information on trade. The HS Codes are maintained by the World Customs Organization (WCO) and are updated periodically to reflect changes in the world economy and trade patterns.

The member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which the Philippines belong to, use the ASEAN Harmonized Tariff Nomenclature (AHTN) to classify goods for the purpose of trade and customs. The AHTN is based on the HS (Harmonized System) of product classification, but has been modified to take into account the specific requirements and trade patterns of ASEAN member countries. The AHTN provides a common set of product codes and definitions that are used by ASEAN member countries to determine the tariffs and other trade measures that apply to imported goods. The use of the AHTN helps to simplify trade and reduce the costs associated with customs procedures, making it easier for businesses to trade within the ASEAN region.

Both HS Codes and ATHN are grouped into 21 Sections and 97 Chapters. Consequently, the Bureau of Customs divide the custom examiners and appraisers into these Sections and assigns the goods accordingly for customs processing.

Let's take a look at the top Chapters contributing to the total importations from 2015 to 2022.

```python
top_chapters()
```
<img src='/images/customs/7.png'>
<img src='/images/customs/8.png'>

Grouping the imported goods from **China** by HSCODE or AHTN code, the above graph shows the top 10 chapters based on dutiable value. Almost 70% of the total dutiable value of the goods from China for the years 2015 to 2022 came from these top 10 chapters.

Goods belonging to Chapters 85 and 84 are the top 1 and 2, respectively. These goods are electrical machinery and equipment and parts thereof; sound recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and reproducers and parts and accessories of such articles and nuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances and parts thereof.

According to DTI's Trade Statistics website, electronic machinery and equipment is also the Philippines' top 1 export product with at least 53% of total exports over the last five years.

On the other hand, meat and edible meat offal and products of animal origin are the least imported goods from China. Vegetable plaiting belonged to the least imported product based on dutiable value.

Importation of live animals and plants is highly regulated and requires permits and clearances from the Bureau of Animal Industry and Bureau of Plant Industry, so it makes sense to be part of the bottom chapters that the Philippines imports from China.

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Results and Discussions</h1>

***
This section discusses the different months which exhibited surges in dutiable values yet have not triggered their corresponding increase in the number of duties and taxes. In order to dissect/describe these irregularities, the team used Ward's method, a hierarchical clustering technique to cluster the imported goods, and compared it against a baseline from the same month, a year prior. Several diagrams will be used to illustrate these findings such as the use of horizontal bar charts, dendrograms, and word clouds.

The first spike in dutiable value occurred in November 2016 and the clusters show that hardware items and electronic items dominated the goods imported from China during this month. This clustering is better than using the HS Code to group the goods. The specific HS code for hardware items can vary widely depending on the type of hardware and its specific use. For example, the HS code for door locks might be 83.06, while the HS code for hand tools might be 82.05. With this clustering, the large variety in goods can be reduced and similar items combined together.¬†Taking the previous year's cluster of goods for the same month, we can see a significant difference. There were more integrated circuit, fabric and apparel that were imported from China and less hardware items traded.

In July 2017, a second spike was observed. The data reveals that hardware items and woven fabric were the main products imported from China, while integrated circuits made a smaller contribution. This is a significant shift from the import situation in July 2016, where integrated circuits were the top imported items and tetra pak machines and spare parts were the second highest.

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Third spike which occured on March 2019</h2>

<img src='/images/customs/17.png'>

<img src='/images/customs/19.png'>
<img src='/images/customs/20.png'>

In March 2019, the third largest increase in the value of taxable goods was recorded. The leading imported products from China were again integrated circuits, followed by raw materials, tetra pak machines, and woven fabric. This is a contrast to the import scenario in March of the previous year, where the tetra pak cluster dominated, with integrated circuits being the second largest cluster.

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Fourth spike which occured on July 2020</h2>

The highest peak in the value of taxable goods was recorded in July 2020, during the implementation of the least restrictive lockdown measures, General Community Quarantine (GCQ). The top two clusters were comprised of integrated circuits and the Mr. DIY cluster, which is a noteworthy cluster as it does not fit into any specific category within the tariff classification handbook. This is an issue that the Bureau of Customs (BOC) should examine. In contrast, during the same month the previous year, the leading clusters were still dominated by integrated circuits, followed by woven fabric and tetra pak machines.

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Conclusion</h1>

***
In conclusion, our analysis of total dutiable values and duties and taxes paid highlights China's remarkable performance among other nations. During the four-month period, the imported goods were efficiently grouped into fewer than 15 clusters through the application of agglomerative clustering. This parsimonious solution was achieved despite the thousands of goods with differing descriptions, reflecting the efficacy of the methodology employed. The first two peaks were dominated by hardware items, while raw materials emerged as the dominant import in the Philippine market during the third peak. The fourth peak was characterized by a significant proportion of imported goods within the integrated circuit cluster. The use of agglomerative clustering was motivated by the existing categorization and taxation system of goods based on their sections and chapters. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of clustering techniques in streamlining the classification of imported goods, thereby facilitating the tax assessment process. The comprehensive methodology employed in this study, as well as the various clustering methods described in the appendix, provide valuable insights into the optimization of the import tax assessment process.

<h1 style="color:#0038a8">Recommendations</h1>

***

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Recommendations for the BoC</h2>

Based on the findings of our analysis, it is recommended that the Bureau of Customs (BoC) consider the integration of innovative clustering techniques, such as agglomerative clustering, into their assessment process. The use of these techniques could potentially provide the BoC with a new and effective method for categorizing and examining various goods, supplementing or even replacing the traditional classification methods, such as sections and chapters. The utilization of clustering techniques, as demonstrated in our study, has the potential to greatly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the import tax assessment process. By taking into account the distinct characteristics of different kinds of goods, clustering techniques can optimize the allocation of resources, thereby improving the overall effectiveness of the assessment process. It is imperative for the BoC to continuously seek new and innovative solutions that will enhance their operational efficiency and effectiveness in the ever-evolving global marketplace. The adoption of clustering techniques, as presented in this study, is a step towards realizing this goal.

<h2 style="color:#87CEEB">Recommendations for further studies</h2>

The current study was limited in scope due to constraints such as time and computational resource limitations. As a result, only a limited dataset was analyzed. Further research is necessary to gain deeper insights and to broaden the understanding of the topic. This can be achieved by expanding the analysis to include data from different administration terms, different exporting countries, and different trade agreements, and by conducting comparative studies utilizing the obtained data. By doing so, the research will be able to provide more comprehensive insights and make more meaningful contributions to the field.
