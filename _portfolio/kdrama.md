# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Korean drama (KDrama) industry has witnessed a remarkable rise in global popularity, captivating audiences with its unique blend of elements. Despite this success, the industry faces significant challenges due to increasing production costs. Striking a balance between creative expression and financial constraints has become a priority for producers seeking innovative ways to create high-quality series that resonate with viewers.

By leveraging machine learning models and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, producers can better navigate these challenges and develop high-quality series that appeal to their target audience.

An analysis of the TMDB KDramas 2022 dataset using AI has revealed intriguing insights into the factors influencing KDrama series' popularity. Certain themes and narratives appear to resonate more with viewers, while others garner less interest. Series based on novels or comics, exploring horror themes, or focusing on boss/employee relationships have higher appeal compared to love triangles, mini-series, and suspense-driven plots. Additionally, historical themes may negatively impact the popularity of high budget, low rating series.

These findings hold significant implications for production companies, as the selection of themes and narratives can substantially impact a KDrama series' popularity. By concentrating on elements that strongly resonate with viewers, companies can improve their chances of producing hit series with high ratings and broad appeal.

In summary, this project underscores the potential of AI and data analysis in uncovering insights into audience preferences and the factors contributing to the success of KDrama series. As the industry continues to grow and evolve, these insights will prove invaluable for producers and creators aiming to develop high-quality, engaging series that captivate viewers worldwide.
