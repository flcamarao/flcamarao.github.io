# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dota 2, a leading multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game, engages two teams of five players in a strategic contest to destroy their opponent's "Ancient" structure while safeguarding their own. With its prominent presence in the esports domain, insights into the determinants of match outcomes hold significant value.

In each match, Radiant and Dire teams consist of five players who adopt specialized roles based on their chosen heroes. The game map comprises diverse elements, including team bases, lanes, shops, and Roshan's lair. Players focus on hero upgrades, item acquisitions, and enemy base destruction to achieve victory.

This study employs machine learning algorithms to analyze collected data, establish baseline scores, and optimize model performance, yielding high-accuracy models for predicting Dota 2 match outcomes. Nevertheless, the reduction of the dataset due to time constraints and computational resources presents a limitation to the study's scope.

Future research can investigate additional models and optimization approaches to augment or supplement existing findings, further advancing our understanding and predictive capabilities for Dota 2 match outcomes.
