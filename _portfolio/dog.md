title: "Paws and Reflect: Which Dog Should I Select?"
excerpt: "The combination of Web Scraping and Dimensionality Reduction techniques can facilitate the analysis and selection of dog breeds. By using an API for breed information, web scraping can collect a large amount of data on various dog breeds. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), can then help identify the most important factors that differentiate the breeds. This can ultimately simplify the decision-making process for selecting a dog breed that best fits an individual's preferences and lifestyle.<br /><img src='/images/dog/1.png'>"

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Executive Summary</h1>

<ins><b>Paws-ing and Reflecting on Selecting a Dog? The Solution is Here for You</b><ins>    

As an aspiring dog owner paws-es and reflects on which dog he/she should select, the team developed a solution to find the intelligent match between an aspiring dog owner and the dog that best fits his/her lifestyle and preferences.
    
<ins><b>Dimensionality Reduction and Information Retrieval Pipeline</b><ins>
    
To go about the solution, the team performed the following:
    
1) **Data Extraction** of the Dogs Dataset comprising of 231 breeds via API [1];<br>
2) **Data Processing** through checking of missing/null values, correction of erroneous data, and feature engineering;<br> 3) **Exploratory Data Analysis** to visualize the distribution of dogs by feature and checking the correlation heatmap;<br>
4) **Dimensionality Reduction** by a) **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)** to determine the minimum number of Principal Components (PCs) that can account for 80% of Cumulative Variance Explained; and b) **Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** to determine the optimal number of latent factors and to take advantage of the symmetrical formulation of NMF to group the dogs into possible clusters;<br>
5) **Information Retrieval** through **cosine distance** to yield the closest match to the dog query entered by the aspiring dog owner;and<br>
6) **Recommendation** of the Top 3 Dogs that best match the features reflecting the aspiring dog owner's preferences and lifestyle.

<ins><b>Results, Insights, and Business Value</b><ins>

Using PCA and NMF, the team was able to: i) find out that the minimum PCs to achieve at least 80% cumulative variance explained is 8; ii) determine that 7 is the optimal number of latent factors; and iii) uncover 7 clusters of dogs classified by the top features per latent factor.

The following insights were gathered:
1) The reduced-dimension has 8 important features:
['energy', 'barking', 'protectiveness', 'shedding', 'ave_life_expectancy', 'drooling', 'ave_height', 'good_with_strangers']<br>
2) Eight (8) latent factors can explain the features in the dataset.<br>
3) The common themes per cluster in the 8 dog clusters are:<br>

Cluster 1: Energetic Big Child-friendly Dogs<br>
Cluster 2: Big Protective Dogs<br>
Cluster 3: High Maintenance Socially Well Dogs<br>
Cluster 4: Loud Dogs<br>
Cluster 5: Energetic Tall Dogs<br>
Cluster 6: Protective yet Playful Dogs<br>
Cluster 7: Easily Trained Active Dogs<br>
Cluster 8: Socially Behaved Dogs <br>

4) To measure success and accuracy, the team set 80% as a threshold for success. Upon measuring information retrieval results using reduced dimensions with a full information retrieval (using all features), the Team obtained a 90% match, which is higher than the expected or set threshold for success.
    
The business value lies in the potential of the solution to serve as a tool (in a kiosk or an app) that pet store owners can use in converting inquiries and clicks into sales. Interested and aspiring dog owners can visit the pet store, the website, or the app and be led to the **Paws and Reflect Solution** to help them make the decision on which dog to select and ultimately welcome to his/her home and family.
    
<ins<b>>Outlook</b><ins>

While the initial gains in the **Paws and Reflect Solution** obtained in this Project have exceeded the performance threshold expectations set by the team, future studies can still be conducted using more data and other sophisticated clustering methods.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Problem Statement</h1>

Problem Statement:
With abundant breeds of dogs, the customer does not necessarily know the exact dog  to select.<br>
The team is solving the following problem:
1) How can the team yield top dog results that match the aspiring dog owner's preference and lifestyle?<br>

From a business perspective, these are the important business questions:<br>
1) The main question of the customer is what dog to select ? What if you have not decided on the dog's features yet? If you wanted the best value for your money by getting the top dog choices, where would you turn to? <br>
2) As a business owner, you would want to give the best customer satisfaction and experience. You want to help the customers make the best possible decision . How do you create this great value-add for  your customers? in the end, it would be a win-win since happier customers translate to loyal customers, and that would most likely drive higher revenues for your business.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Introduction</h1>

<b><ins>Joy in Owning a Dog</ins></b>
    
The team believes that many people find joy in owning a dog. The remarkable interaction with the dogs we live it stay with us for life. 

Dogs have amazing social intelligence that they have perfected through time being in the presence of humans. Dogs know when it is time for bath, food and walks - partly based on the family routine and partly based on the dogsâ€™ good sense of light change, cycles, and smell.[2]
    
<b><ins>With Good Dogs Come Great Responsibility</ins></b>
    
They are a delight to have around and play with but they also require consistent care. Dogs have to be fed, exercised, groomed, bathed, and given routine veterinary care.

<b><ins>Dog Search Using Technologies</ins></b>

Artificial Intelligence has been used to identify dogs by breed through What-Dog.net and other applications in the App Store. One can identify a dog's breed, learn about its temperament, find similar dogs, and more online.[3] The team aimed to take the dog search technology a bit further.
    
<b><ins>Paw-fect Match</ins></b>

The **Paws and Reflect Solution** developed by the team narrows down the match to Top 3 Dogs to aid the aspiring dog owner in finally making a decision in which dog to bring home.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Methodology</h1>

A high-level methodology description of the steps taken by the team to create the project.

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Data Collection</h2>

For the data collection, the team utilized the Dogs API to perform the data extraction. The team followed the documentation from the source API to conduct multiple API calls to extract all data available.

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Data Preprocessing</h2>

For the data preprocessing, the team conducted these steps:
- **Data Cleaning**
    - checked for duplicate data
    - corrected the value of outliers
    - checked for missing data
    - validated the data
- **Feature Engineering**
    - created new features by combining data from existing features
    - dropped sourced features for the new features
    - created bins for features to properly scale the data

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>

For the EDA, the team analyses the dataset to see information such as:
- Social
- Personality
- Physical
- Size and Life

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

For the dimensionality reduction, the team performed:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Information Retrieval</h2>

For the information retrieval, the team used Cosine distance to retrieve the top 10 Dog Breeds nearest to the query. Also performed was another information retrieval, but this time, the features used for the query were reduced based on the results of the dimensionality reduction.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Data Sources and Description</h1>

  <h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Import Libraries</h2>

  To solve the problem presented, the team imported first all necessary libraries. The imports can be divided into: 
* Basic Imports
* API
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Information Retrieval

```python
# Basic Imports
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import math
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.ticker import MaxNLocator
from IPython.display import display, clear_output

# API
import requests

# Dimensionality Reduction
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA, NMF

# Information Retrieval
from scipy.spatial import distance
import ipywidgets as widgets
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
```

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">API Request</h2>

The team used **Dog Dataset** to answer the question: *Which Dog Should I Select?*. 
The dog dataset was extracted using the API of api-ninjas.com using an API key. [[2]](https://api-ninjas.com/api/dogs)
<img src='/images/dog/2.png'>

```python
# Endpt and API key setup
api_key = "o3NqUjG9GfPYi2830ju6Jg==ZCPKK5C8AG1AOhIB"
end_pt = "https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/dogs"
headers = {'X-Api-Key': api_key}
params = {}
ls_dogs = []

# Retrieved data from API
for barking_i in range(1, 6):
    params.update({'barking': barking_i})
    for offset_i in range(1, 101, 20):
        params.update({'offset': offset_i})
        resp = requests.get(end_pt, params=params, headers=headers).json()
        if len(resp) == 0:
            break
        else:
            ls_dogs.extend(resp)
```

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Data Cleaning</h2>

To visualize the data the team used *Pandas DataFrame*. Shown below is the raw data extracted from the API.
```python
data = pd.DataFrame(ls_dogs)
display(data)
```
<img src='/images/dog/3.png'>

Before we do anything with the dataset, the team first verifies the datatype, missing values, and erroneous data. Shown below are the data types of each column.
```python
display(data.dtypes)
```
The team verified that all numerical columns are of type int or float from the output. In addition, there are only two object datatypes: `image_link` and `name`. These two object datatype was expected, given that those columns are strings. Therefore **all data types are correct**.
The next step is to check if the dataset has missing values. NaN represents missing values.

```python
display(data.isna().sum())
```
The count of missing values per column is displayed. From this, the team verified that there are **no missing values in the dataset**.
The next step is to check for erroneous data (extreme outliers). This step is done by displaying the range of values for each numerical column.

```python
print("Column value range:\n")
for col_name in data.columns[1:-1]:
    print(f"{col_name} has a value range of {data[col_name].min()} "
          f"to {data[col_name].max()}.")
```
<img src='/images/dog/4.png'>

In the output, the team observed that `min_life_expectancy` and `max_life_expectancy` have erroneous data, a dog with 1214 expected life years. So the team checked the dog's name and searched for the correct value.

```python
old = data.loc[data['max_life_expectancy'] >= 1214.0, 'name'].index[0]
print(f"In the database, {data.loc[old, 'name']} has minimum life "
      f"expectancy of {data.loc[old, 'min_life_expectancy']} and "
      f" maximum life expectancy of {data.loc[old, 'max_life_expectancy']}.")
```
From the website of dogtime.com, *Small Munsterlander* has a `min_life_expectancy` of 12 and `max_life_expectancy` of 14. The error might have been caused by the accidental removal of the hyphen in 12-14 years, resulting in 1214 years. The team corrected this in the dataset. [[5]](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/small-munsterlander-pointer#/slide/1)

```python
data.loc[old, 'min_life_expectancy'] = 12
data.loc[old, 'max_life_expectancy'] = 14
```
The team verified the value range of minimum and maximum life expectancy again.

```python
print("Column value range:\n")
for col_name in ['min_life_expectancy', 'max_life_expectancy']:
    print(f"{col_name} has a value range of {data[col_name].min()} "
          f"to {data[col_name].max()}.")
```
The numerical columns values were now **all cleaned and within the reasonable range**.
The last step in data cleaning is to sort the dataframe based on `name` and set it as the index. Shown below is the updated database.
```python
data = data.sort_values(by='name').set_index('name')
display(data)
```
<img src='/images/dog/5.png'>

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Feature Engineering</h2>

Life expectancy, height, and weight were over-represented in the dataset by having more than one column that described them. To address this, the team created a new column to represent the average of their values.
* For life expectancy, the average of the min and max life expectancy was set as a new column called `ave_life_expectancy`.
* For height and weight, the average of min and max for both sexes will be set as a new column called `ave_height` and `ave_weight`, respectively.

```python
data['ave_life_expectancy'] = (data['min_life_expectancy'] +
                               data['max_life_expectancy']) / 2
data['ave_height'] = (data['max_height_male'] + data['max_height_female'] +
                      data['min_height_male'] + data['min_height_female']) / 4
data['ave_weight'] = (data['max_weight_male'] + data['max_weight_female'] +
                      data['min_weight_male'] + data['min_weight_female']) / 4
```
These three columns: `ave_life_expectancy`, `ave_height`, and `ave_weight`, represent a measurement that has a scale different from other columns, which has a scale of 1 to 5 (some start at 0). To solve this scaling issue, the team binned these measurements into discrete values of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest value.

```python
dog_data = data.copy(deep=True)
cols_bin = ['ave_life_expectancy', 'ave_height', 'ave_weight']
labels = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for col in cols_bin:
    boundaries = data[col].value_counts(bins=5, sort=False).index
    bins = []
    for i, boundary in enumerate(boundaries):
        if i == 0:
            bins.append(math.floor(boundary.left))
        else:
            bins.append(round(boundary.left))
        if i == 4:
            bins.append(math.floor(boundary.right))
            
    dog_data[col] = pd.cut(x=dog_data[col], bins=bins, labels=labels,
                       include_lowest=True)

# Change to int datatype
dog_data = dog_data.astype({'ave_life_expectancy': 'int', 'ave_height': 'int',
                    'ave_weight': 'int'})
```
Next step is to drop any unnecessary/redundant columns, retaining only our 15 features as described in the Data Description section above.

```python
# Drop the unnecessary columns
df = dog_data.drop(columns=['image_link', 'min_life_expectancy',
                        'max_life_expectancy', 'max_height_male',
                        'max_height_female', 'min_height_male',
                        'min_height_female', 'max_weight_male',
                        'max_weight_female', 'min_weight_male',
                        'min_weight_female'])
display(df)
```
<img src='/images/dog/6.png'>

```python
# Set up of other necessary variables
# Equivalent numpy of our dataframe.
X = df.to_numpy()

# Array of features
feature_arr = np.array(list(df.columns))

# List of string format features (english equivalent of column names)
feature_str = ['Good with Children', 'Good with Other Dogs', 'Shedding',
               'Grooming', 'Drooling', 'Coat Length', 'Good with Strangers',
               'Playfulness', 'Protectiveness', 'Trainability', 'Energy',
               'Barking', 'Average Life Expectancy', 'Average Height',
               'Average Weight']

# Array of dogs
dog_arr = np.array(list(df.index))

# Figure caption
fig_num = 1
def fig_caption(title, caption):
    """Print figure caption on jupyter notebook"""
    global fig_num
    display(HTML(f"""<p style="font-size:11px;font-style:default;"><b>
                     Figure {fig_num}. {title}.</b><br>{caption}</p>"""))
    fig_num += 1
```

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>

According to American Kennel Club these 15 features can be grouped together into 4 categories. Shown below are the category of each feature. [2]

* Social
    * Playfulness
    * Good with Other Dogs
    * Good with Stangers
    * Good with Children
* Personality
    * Energy
    * Barking
    * Trainability
    * Protectiveness
* Physical
    * Shedding
    * Grooming
    * Coat Length
    * Drooling
* Size and Life
    * Life Expectancy
    * Heigth
    * Length

The following plots shows the distributions of dogs according to each of those 15 features.

<h3 style="color:#AB8F8F">Social</h3>

```python
cols_index = [0, 1, 6, 7]

<img src='/images/dog/23.png'>

**Insights:**
* Average height strongly correlated with average weight. These are eminent on breeds such as Neapolitan Mastiff, Newfoundland, and Pyrenean Mastiff.
* Dogs that are playful are generally also good with strangers. Dogs that are good with other dogs are good with kids as well. 
* Some features are negatively correlated such as protectiveness and good with other dogs, as protective dogs that guard their owners well are not receptive with other dogs.
* Heavy dogs tend to have lower life expectancies as well. One reason for this is that larger dogs die earlier because they age significantly faster compared to smaller dogs.

<h3 style="color:#AB8F8F">Height and Weight Relationship Plot</h3>
The team looked into the specific relationship of height and weight.

```python
# Height vs Weight (Positive Correlation)
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 6))
ax = sns.regplot(x=data['ave_weight'], y=data['ave_height'], color="#DA5F70")
ax.set_title('Height vs Weight Scatter Diagram')
ax.set_xlabel('Average Weight')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Height')
plt.show()
```
<img src='/images/dog/24.png'>

**Insight:**
* There is a  linear relationship between the variables ( Average weight against average height)
* It can be seen that some dogs have heaver weight but have the same height with dogs with lighter weight, since we are only getting the height of dogs and didn't include their width/length.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Results and Discussion</h1>

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Dimensionality Reduction</h2>

<h3 style="color:#AB8F8F">Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h3>
The team used Principal Component Analysis or PCA to determine the top features that defines most of the variance. `sklearn PCA` method was used.

```python
# PCA
pca = PCA()
X_center = (X - X.mean(axis=0)) / X.std(axis=0)
pca.fit_transform(X_center)
var_exp = pca.explained_variance_ratio_
w = pca.components_
X_new = np.dot(X_center, w)
```
The team determined the minimum value of principal components (PCs) to achieved 80% cumulative variance explained. Shown below are the plot for the variance explained ratio and its cumulative.

```python
# Plot of variance explained and Cummulative Variance Explained
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
ax.plot(range(1, len(var_exp)+1), var_exp.cumsum(), 'o-', label='cumulative')
ax.plot(range(1, len(var_exp)+1), var_exp, 'o-', label='individual')

ax.set_ylim(0, 1.05)
ax.axhline(0.8, ls='--', color='#DA5F70')
ax.axvline(8, ls='--', color='#DA5F70')
ax.set_xlabel('Principal Component')

```
<img src='/images/dog/25.png'>

```python
min_pcs = np.argmax(var_exp.cumsum() >= 0.80) + 1
print(f"The minimum PCs to achieve at least 80% cummulative variance explained is "
      f"{min_pcs}.")
```
The team plotted the transformed original features onto the first two PCs.
```python
# Plot the transformed data on the first 2 PCs w/ transformed features
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, subplot_kw=dict(aspect='equal'), figsize=(10, 10))
ax.scatter(X_new[:,0], X_new[:,1])
for feature, vec in zip(feature_arr, w):
    ax.arrow(0, 0, 5*vec[0], 5*vec[1], width=0.02, ec='none', fc='r')
    ax.text(5.5*vec[0], 5.5*vec[1], feature, ha='center', color='r', size=10)

ax.set_title('Dogs Dataset on PC1 and PC2 axis', size=20)
plt.show()
fig_caption('Dogs Dataset on PC1 and PC2 axis', '')
```
<img src='/images/dog/26.png'>

**Insights:**

*Coordinates*
* Positive PC1 is mainly described by high values of features: `good_with_other_dogs`, `good_with_strangers`, `barking`.
* Negative PC1 is mainy described by high values of features: `energy`, and `protectiveness`.
* Negative PC2 is mainly described by high values of features: `barking`, `trainability`.
* Positive PC2 is mainly described by high values of features: `grooming`, `good_with_other_dogs`.

*Correlations*
* `protectiveness`, and `energy` are fairly correlated. These features are anticorrelated to `good_with_strangers`.
* `grooming` and `good_with_other_dogs` are fairly correlated.
* `barking` and `trainability` are fairly correlated.
* `grooming` and `good_with_other_dogs` is fairly orthogonal to `trainability` and `barking`. This suggest independence between those features.

*Clusters*
* There are no observable clustering in the data points.

*Funnels*
* There are no observable funneling in the data points.

*Voids*
* There are no observable voids in the data points. This suggests that all combination of features are possible.

The following plots shows the feature contributing to the first 8 PCs.
```python
for i in range(min_pcs):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

**Insights:**
* PC1 - Negative PC1 corresponds to `energy` and `protectiveness` while positive PC1 corresponds to `good_with_other_dogs` and `barking`.
* PC2 - Negative PC2 corresponds to `barking` and `trainability` while positive PC2 corresponds to `grooming`, and `good_with_other_dogs`.

* PC5 - Negative PC5 corresponds to `playfulness` and `shedding` while positive PC5 corresponds to `ave_life_expectancy`, and `good_with_children`.
* PC6 - Negative PC6 corresponds to `good_with_strangers` and `shedding` while positive PC6 corresponds to `drooling`, and `grooming`.
* PC7 - Negative PC7 corresponds to `ave_height` and `good_with_strangers` while positive PC7 corresponds to `trainability`, and `energy`.
* PC8 - Negative PC8 corresponds to `good_with_strangers` and `good_with_children` while positive PC8 corresponds to `ave_height`, and `good_with_other_dogs`.

Shown below are the top influencing features per PCs.
```python
pc_dict = {}
for i in range(len(w)):
    pc_dict.update({f"PC{i+1}": feature_arr[(np.argsort(-np.abs(w[:, i])))]})
pc_features = pd.DataFrame(pc_dict)
display(pc_features)
```
<img src='/images/dog/35.png'>

Here are the exact values:
```python
pc_dict = {}
for i in range(len(w)):
    pc_dict.update({f"PC{i+1}": w[:, i]})
pc_values = pd.DataFrame(pc_dict, index=feature_arr)
display(pc_values)
```
<img src='/images/dog/36.png'>

Using the first 8 PCs, the top features were determined to create to reduced-dimension dataframe.
```python
imp_feature = []
for col_i in range(min_pcs):
    for row_i in range(len(pc_features)):
        if pc_features.iloc[row_i, col_i] not in imp_feature:
            imp_feature.append(pc_features.iloc[row_i, col_i])
            break
print(f"The reduced-dimension has {len(imp_feature)} important features.")
```

**Insights:**
* The team looked at the top features per principal component and they are energy, barking, protectiveness, shedding, average life expectancy, drooling, average height, and good with strangers, respectively.
* For PC1, this principal component increases as energy decreases, while for PC2, the PC increases as barking decreases.
* PC3 increases as protectiveness decreases, PC4 increases as shedding decreases, PC5 increases as average life expectancy increases, and PC6 increases as drooling decreases.
* PC7 increases as average height decreases and while energy increases, and lastly PC8 increases as average height increases and good with strangers decreases.

The reduced feature dataframe is shown below.
```python
# Get the reduced dataset
df_red = df.copy(deep=True)[imp_feature]
X_red = df_red.to_numpy()
display(df_red)
```

<h3 style="color:#AB8F8F">Non-negative Matrix-Factorization (NMF)</h3>

The team used Non-negative matrix-factorization (NMF) to determine the features cluster and dog clusters. First in order to determine the number of latent factor, the team used Frobenius norm of the original matrix vs the reconstructed matrix at different values of latent factors (k). Shown below is the plot of Frobenius norm at k value from 2 to 15.
```python
f_norm = []
for k in range(2, len(feature_arr) + 1):
    nmf = NMF(n_components=k, max_iter=10_000)
    U = nmf.fit_transform(X)
    V = nmf.components_.T
    f_norm.append(((X - U @ V.T) ** 2).sum())

# Plot Frobenius norm
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(range(2, len(f_norm) + 2), f_norm, 'o-')
ax.set_xlabel('k')
ax.set_ylabel('Frobenius norm')
ax.set_title('Frobenius norm vs Latent Factors (k)')
plt.show()
fig_caption('Frobenius norm vs Latent Factors (k)', '')
```
<img src='/images/dog/38.png'>

The "knee" of the plot is not clearly defined. So, the team proceed to analyze the numerical value of frobenius norm to determine at whch value of k that the reduction of reconstruction error has diminishing returns.

```python
# Analyzing the number
f_diff = np.array([f_norm[i-1] - f_norm[i]
                   for i in range(1, len(f_norm))])
min_lfs = np.where(f_diff < 150)[0][0] + 3  # f_diff starts at LF 3
print(f"The optimal number of latent factors is {min_lfs}.")
```
Shown below is the plot of latent factors vs Original Dimensions, where white box corresponds to the zero (0) factor.

```python
nmf = NMF(n_components=min_lfs, max_iter=1_000)
U = nmf.fit_transform(df)
V = nmf.components_.T

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
ax.spy(V)
ax.set_xticks(range(len(feature_arr)))
ax.set_yticks(range(len(feature_arr)))
ax.set_yticklabels(feature_arr)
ax.set_title('Latent Factors vs Original Dimensions')
plt.show()
fig_caption('Latent Factors vs Original Dimensions', '')
```
<img src='/images/dog/39.png'>

Now using seven latent factors, the team determined the defining characteristics and labeled each clusters.
```python
# Plot of feature influence on Latent Factors
for i in range(min_lfs):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    order = np.argsort(np.abs(V[:, i]))[-10:]
    ax.barh([feature_arr[o] for o in order], V[order, i])
    ax.set_title(f'Top Feature Contributor on LF{i+1}')
    ax.set_xlabel('Affinity Value')
plt.show()
fig_caption('Top Feature Contributor of LF1 to LF8', '')
```

<img src='/images/dog/46.png'>
<img src='/images/dog/47.png'>

**Insights:**
* Latent Factor 1 - Energetic Big Child-friendly Dogs
* Latent Factor 2 - Big Protective Dogs
* Latent Factor 3 - High Maintenance Socially Well Dogs
* Latent Factor 4 - Loud Dogs
* Latent Factor 5 - Energetic Tall Dogs
* Latent Factor 6 - Protective yet Playful Dogs
* Latent Factor 7 - Easily Trained ActiveDogs
* Latent Factor 8 - Socially Behaved Dogs

```python
lf_labels = ['Energetic Big Child-friendly Dogs', 'Big Protective Dogs',
             'High Maintenance Socially Well Dogs',
             'Very Vocal Dogs', 'Energetic Tall Dogs',
             'Protective yet Playful Dogs', 'Easily Trained ActiveDogs',
             'Socially Behaved Dogs']
```

Using these latent factors labels, the affinity of each dog to a cluster was determined. Shown below is the translated value into first 2 PCs with color representing unique cluster
```python
# Clustering by assigning them to the latent factor with the highest weight
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))
pca_nmf = PCA(2)
ax.scatter(*pca_nmf.fit_transform(X_center).T,
           c=U.argmax(axis=1), cmap='Set1')
ax.set_xlabel('PC1')
ax.set_ylabel('PC2')
ax.set_title('PC Axis with Clustering')
plt.show()
fig_caption('PC Axis with Clustering', '')
```
<img src='/images/dog/48.png'>

The clusters of each dog was determined. Some cluster doesn't have any member this is because dogs that might be classified into these clusters have more affinity towards other clusters.
```python
# Clustering
df_cluster = df.copy()
df_cluster['nmf_cluster'] = U.argmax(axis=1)

for i in range(8):
    nmf_cluster = list(df_cluster[df_cluster['nmf_cluster'] == i].index)
    print(f"{lf_labels[i]}:\n {nmf_cluster}\n")
```

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Information Retrieval (IR)</h2>

To determine the performance of dimensionality reduction the team perform information retrieval on both datasets that are full 15 features and reduced to 8 features. The similarity score used for information retrival is cosine distance because all of the data in our dataset are non-negative.
```python
def nearest_dog(query, obj, dog_arr, k):
    """Returns the top k nearest dog to the query from the obj."""
    near_k = np.argsort([distance.cosine(query, vec) for vec in obj])[:k]
    near_dog = dog_arr[near_k]
    return near_dog

top_count = 10
dog_index = 167
print(f"IR will retrieved the top {top_count} nearest dog from the query. The "
      f"sample dog querry is {dog_arr[dog_index]}.")
```

Instead of asking for the 15 features to come up with a recommended dog, the team reduced it to 8 questions (features). This reduced questions still yields a significant % accuracy base from the original dimensions results.
```python
# Sample original dimension query
sample_orig = X[dog_index, :]

# Get the top 20% nearest from the query
search_orig = nearest_dog(sample_orig, X, dog_arr, top_count)
print(f"The top {top_count} nearest dog from our query "
      f"are:\n\n{search_orig}\n\n")

# Sample reduced-dimension query
sample_red = X_red[dog_index, :]

# Get the top 20% nearest from the query
search_red = nearest_dog(sample_red, X_red, dog_arr, top_count)
print(f"Using the reduced features, the top {top_count} nearest dog from "
     f"our query are:\n\n{search_red}\n\n")

# Get the % match between the original and reduced-dimension
count = 0
for i in search_orig:
    if i in search_red:
        count += 1
pct_match = count / top_count * 100
print(f"The percent match between the original search and reduced-dimension "
      f"search is {pct_match:.0f}%")
```
<img src='/images/dog/49.png'>

This high percentage match indicates that instead of asking for all 15 features the program could focus only on the 8 important features.

<h2 style="color:#BC7E7E">Which Dog Should I Select?</h2>

Going back to the question "Which Dog Should I Select", the team develop an interactive jupyter notebook widget. This interface will return the top 3 recommended dogs base on the user input.

```python
def search_query():
    user_query = np.array([energy.value, barking.value, protectiveness.value,
                           shedding.value, ave_life_expectancy.value,

                           good_with_strangers.value])

    # Search the top 3 dogs
    search_results = nearest_dog(user_query, X_red, dog_arr, 3)

    # Display the dog image
    for dog_name in search_results:
        resp = requests.get(data.loc[dog_name, 'image_link'])

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Conclusion</h1>

The team looked at 231 different breeds of dogs and found that there are features that contribute the most in selecting the preferred dogs. These features are namely energy, barking, protectiveness, shedding, average life expectancy, drooling, average height, and good with strangers. There are features that correlate positively with other features - for example, dogs that are playful are generally also good with strangers. Dogs that are good with other dogs are good with kids as well. Heavy dogs tend to have lower life expectancies as well.

Using the top features that emerged from doing the Principal Components Analysis, the team did Information Retrieval, looked at the top 10 results, and compared it with the Information Retrieval using all the features. Interestingly, 90% of the results matched. We can now answer the question "Which dog should I select?" by asking the features that contribute the most in selecting the right dog breed.

So if you ever find yourself paw-sing and reflecting on getting a furry friend, give our team a call. Weâ€™re the right tree to bark up. Weâ€™re excited to be part of your journey in selecting the paw-fect dog for you.

<h1 style="color:#DA5F70">Recommendations</h1>

The system may be further improved by conducting the following:
* Other clustering methods may be explored outside of NMF. K-means clustering or Density based clustering methods such as DBSCAN or OPTICS may be considered in grouping the different breeds of dogs before doing the information retrieval. With this, the system can determine the preferred characteristics of the person and then look at the dogs within specific clusters, not necessarily looking into the whole dataset every query.
* Aside from only looking at the top features per principal component, future studies may consider on taking into account 'obvious' values on select features. For example, the most preferred average life expectancy is 5, since people generally want their dogs to live the longest.
* Adding other relevant features such as price and availability in the region or country may also be considered.
