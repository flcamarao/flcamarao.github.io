Unleashing the power of data & code, one line at a time! I'm a Digital Transformer, Data Scientist, Systems Architect, and Software Engineer on a mission to transform complex problems into elegant solutions. Armed with curiosity and creativity, I venture into the realms of data, technology, and innovation, striving to make a lasting impact. Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!



In the field of data science, my interests lie in the following areas:
* Complex systems and network science 🕸️
* Deep Learning and Neural Networks 🧠
* Natural language processing 🗣️
* Geospatial analysis 🌍
* Recommender systems 💡
* Explainable AI 🤖
* Computer Vision 👁️

I am particularly interested in exploring these domains to develop innovative and impactful solutions to real-world problems.
